Socket.IO makes it easy to send events to all the connected clients.

Please note that broadcasting is a **server-only** feature.

## To all connected clients

![Broadcasting to all connected clients](/images/broadcasting.png)

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  io.emit("hello", "world");
});
```

## To all connected clients except the sender

![Broadcasting to all connected clients excepting the sender](/images/broadcasting2.png)

```js
// server-side
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.broadcast.emit("hello", "world");
});
```

## With multiple Socket.IO servers

Broadcasting also works with multiple Socket.IO servers.

You just need to replace the default [Adapter](/docs/v3/glossary/#Adapter) by the Redis Adapter. More information about it [here](/docs/v3/using-multiple-nodes/#Passing-events-between-nodes).

In certain cases, you may want to only broadcast to clients that are connected to the current server. You can achieve this with the `local` flag:

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  io.local.emit("hello", "world");
});
```

In order to target specific clients when broadcasting, please see the documentation about [Rooms](/docs/v3/rooms/).
