A *room* is an arbitrary channel that sockets can `join` and `leave`. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients:

Please note that rooms are a **server-only** concept (i.e. the client does not have access to the list of rooms it has joined).

## Joining and leaving

You can call `join` to subscribe the socket to a given channel:

```js
io.on('connection', socket => {
  socket.join('some room');
});
```

And then simply use `to` or `in` (they are the same) when broadcasting or emitting:

```js
io.to('some room').emit('some event');
```

You can emit to several rooms at the same time:

```js
io.to('room1').to('room2').to('room3').emit('some event');
```

In that case, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)">union</a> is performed: every socket that is at least in one of the rooms will get the event **once** (even if the socket is in two or more rooms).

You can also broadcast to a room from a given socket:

```js
io.on('connection', function(socket){
  socket.to('some room').emit('some event');
});
```

In that case, every socket in the room **excluding** the sender will get the event.

To leave a channel you call `leave` in the same fashion as `join`.

## Default room

Each `Socket` in Socket.IO is identified by a random, unguessable, unique identifier [Socket#id](/docs/v3/server-socket-instance/#Socket-id). For your convenience, each socket automatically joins a room identified by its own id.

This makes it easy to implement private messages:

```js
io.on("connection", socket => {
  socket.on("private message", (anotherSocketId, msg) => {
    socket.to(anotherSocketId).emit("private message", socket.id, msg);
  });
});
```

## Sample use cases

- broadcast data to each device / tab of a given user

```js
io.on('connection', async (socket) => {
  const userId = await fetchUserId(socket);

  socket.join(userId);

  // and then later
  io.to(userId).emit('hi');
});
```

- send notifications about a given entity

```js
io.on('connection', async (socket) => {
  const projects = await fetchProjects(socket);

  projects.forEach(project => socket.join('project:' + project.id));

  // and then later
  io.to('project:4321').emit('project updated');
});
```

## Disconnection

Upon disconnection, sockets `leave` all the channels they were part of automatically, and no special teardown is needed on your part.

You can fetch the rooms the Socket was in by listening to the `disconnecting` event:

```js
io.on('connection', socket => {
  socket.on('disconnecting', () => {
    console.log(socket.rooms); // the Set contains at least the socket ID
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    // socket.rooms.size === 0
  });
});
```

## With multiple Socket.IO servers

Like [global broadcasting](/docs/v3/broadcasting-events/#With-multiple-Socket-IO-servers), broadcasting to rooms also works with multiple Socket.IO servers.

You just need to replace the default [Adapter](/docs/v3/glossary/#Adapter) by the Redis Adapter. More information about it [here](/docs/v3/using-multiple-nodes/#Passing-events-between-nodes).
